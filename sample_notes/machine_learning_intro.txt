Machine Learning Introduction
==========================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled data to train models
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finds patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Common Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

Popular ML Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General purpose ML library
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework by Google
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework by Facebook
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library
- Keras: High-level neural networks API

Getting Started:
1. Learn Python programming basics
2. Understand statistics and linear algebra
3. Practice with real datasets
4. Start with simple algorithms
5. Gradually move to complex models
