# Deep Learning Concepts

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It has revolutionized many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Neural Network Basics

### Perceptron
The simplest form of a neural network with:
- Input layer
- Weights and biases
- Activation function
- Output

### Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Input layer
- Hidden layers
- Output layer
- Backpropagation for training

## Key Concepts

### Activation Functions
- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit, f(x) = max(0, x)
- **Sigmoid**: S-shaped curve, outputs between 0 and 1
- **Tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent, outputs between -1 and 1
- **Softmax**: Used for multi-class classification

### Loss Functions
