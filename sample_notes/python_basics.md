# Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## Key Features

- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language
- **Versatile**: Can be used for web development, data science, automation, and more
- **Large Community**: Extensive libraries and frameworks available
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Basic Syntax

Variables in Python are dynamically typed:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

## Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures:
- Lists: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Tuples: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Dictionaries: `{"key": "value"}`
- Sets: `{1, 2, 3}`

## Popular Libraries

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Django/Flask**: Web development
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning
