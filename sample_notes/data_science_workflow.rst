Data Science Workflow
====================

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract insights from structured and unstructured data.

The Data Science Process
========================

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Identify business objectives
   - Define success metrics
   - Determine data requirements

2. **Data Collection**
   - Gather data from various sources
   - APIs, databases, web scraping
   - Surveys and experiments

3. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Understand data structure
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates and outliers
   - Data type conversions

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Data visualization
   - Identify patterns and correlations
   - Feature engineering

5. **Model Building**
   - Select appropriate algorithms
   - Train models on data
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Cross-validation

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics
   - Confusion matrices
   - ROC curves
   - A/B testing

7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Model deployment to production
   - Performance monitoring
   - Model updates and maintenance
