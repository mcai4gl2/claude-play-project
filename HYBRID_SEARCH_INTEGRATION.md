### 6. **Enhanced CLI** (`notes_app.py`)
- ✅ New search modes: `--mode auto|traditional|semantic|hybrid`
- ✅ Search explanations: `--explain` flag
- ✅ New `stats` command for comprehensive statistics
- ✅ Visual indicators for different search modes
- ✅ Detailed result analysis and fusion method display

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Hybrid Search
```bash
# Auto mode (intelligent routing)
python notes_app.py query "machine learning tutorial" --mode auto

# Semantic search (vector-only)
python notes_app.py query "deep learning concepts" --mode semantic

# Traditional search (BM25-only)  
python notes_app.py query "python programming" --mode traditional

# Hybrid search (always combine both)
python notes_app.py query "neural networks" --mode hybrid
```

### Advanced Features
```bash
# Search with detailed explanations
python notes_app.py query "machine learning" --explain

# View comprehensive statistics
python notes_app.py stats

# Search with filters and thresholds
python notes_app.py query "python tutorial" --threshold 0.7 --mode hybrid
```

## 🚀 Key Features Delivered

### 1. **Intelligent Query Routing**
- Automatically detects query intent (exact vs conceptual)
- Routes to optimal search engine based on query type
- Provides confidence scores and reasoning

### 2. **Advanced Search Modes**
- **Auto**: Smart routing based on query analysis
- **Traditional**: Pure keyword-based search (BM25)
- **Semantic**: Pure vector-based search 
- **Hybrid**: Always combines both approaches
- **Custom**: User-defined weighting

### 3. **Sophisticated Result Fusion**
- Multiple fusion algorithms for different use cases
- Adaptive weighting based on query confidence
- Deduplication and score normalization
- Detailed explanations of fusion process

### 4. **Rich Query Analysis**
- Phrase extraction ("machine learning")
- Filter detection (filetype:py, year:2023)
- Boolean operator handling (AND, OR, NOT)
- Term expansion with synonyms
- Query suggestions and improvements

### 5. **Comprehensive Statistics**
- Search usage patterns by mode
- Fusion algorithm performance
- Query processing metrics
- Average result counts and quality

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- Existing CLI commands work unchanged
- Default behavior remains semantic search
- Existing vector index reused without modification
- No breaking changes to current API
